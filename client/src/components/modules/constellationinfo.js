Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the north pole star.",
"Draco" :  "Draco is a constellation in the far northern sky. Its name is Latin for dragon. Draco is circumpolar (that is, never setting), and can be seen all year from northern latitudes. In Greco-Roman legend, Draco was a dragon killed by the goddess Minerva and tossed into the sky upon his defeat. As Minerva threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold North Celestial Pole before it could right itself. One of the deep-sky objects in Draco is the Cat's Eye Nebula, a planetary nebula approximately 3,000 light-years away that was discovered by English astronomer William Herschel in 1786.",
"Lyra" : "Lyra is a small constellation, one of the 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre. Vega, Lyra's brightest star, is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, and forms a corner of the famed Summer Triangle asterism. In Greek mythology, Lyra represents the lyre of Orpheus. Made by Hermes from a tortoise shell, given to Apollo as a bargain, it was said to be the first lyre ever produced. Orpheus's music was said to be so great that even inanimate objects such as trees, streams, and rocks could be charmed.",
"Cepheus" : "Cepheus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after Cepheus, a king of Aethiopia in Greek mythology. He was married to Cassiopeia and was the father of Andromeda, both of whom are immortalized as modern day constellations along with Cepheus. Cepheus is most commonly depicted as holding his arms aloft, praying for the deities to spare the life of Andromeda. He also is depicted as a more regal monarch sitting on his throne. Alpha Cephei, also known as Alderamin, is the brightest star in the constellation, with an apparent magnitude of 2.51.",
"Cassiopeia" : "Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the vain queen Cassiopeia in Greek mythology, who boasted about her unrivaled beauty.  She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive W shape, formed by five bright stars.",
"Camelopardalis" : "Camelopardalis is a large but faint constellation of the northern sky representing a giraffe. The constellation was introduced in 1613 by Petrus Plancius. In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Camelopardalis are located within a group of circumpolar stars called the Purple Forbidden Enclosure.",
"Lynx" : "Lynx is a constellation named after the animal, usually observed in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere. The constellation was introduced in the late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. Naming it Lynx because of its faintness, he challenged future stargazers to see it, declaring that only the lynx-eyed (those with good sight) would have been able to recognize it. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line.",
"Ursa Major" : "Ursa Major, also known as the Great Bear, is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations. It is primarily known from the asterism of its main seven stars, which has been called the Big Dipper, the Wagon or the Plough, among other names. In particular, the Big Dipper mimics the shape of the Little Dipper. Two of its stars, Dubhe and Merak, can be used as the navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. Ursa Major is significant to numerous world cultures, often as a symbol of the north.",
"Virgo": "Virgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for virgin. Lying between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, it is the second-largest constellation in the sky (after Hydra) and the largest constellation in the zodiac.

The Romans associated it with their goddess Ceres. During the Middle Ages, Virgo sometimes was associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary.",
"Serpens": "Serpens, Greek for the serpent, is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the Serpent-Bearer. In Greek mythology, Serpens represents a snake held by the healer Asclepius.

"Coma Berenices": "Coma Berenices is an ancient asterism in the northern sky. Its name means Berenice's Hair in Latin and refers to Queen Berenice II of Egypt, who sacrificed her long hair as a votive offering.  It was introduced to Western astronomy during the third century BC by Conon of Samos. Coma Berenices is the only modern constellation named for a historic person. The constellation is the radiant of one meteor shower, Coma Berenicids, which has one of the fastest meteor speeds.",
"Canes Venatici": "Canes Venatici is a small northern constellation that was created by Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century. Its name is Latin for hunting dogs, and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of Boötes the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation. Cor Caroli is the constellation's brightest star, with an apparent magnitude of 2.9. La Superba is one of the reddest stars in the sky and one of the brightest carbon stars. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the Whirlpool Galaxy,  the first galaxy whose spiral nature was discerned.",
"Corona Borealis": "Corona Borealis is a small constellation. Its brightest stars form a semicircular arc. Its Latin name, inspired by its shape, means northern crown. In classical mythology Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god Dionysus to the Cretan princess Ariadne and set by him in the heavens.

"Boötes": "Boötes comes from Greek meaning herdsman or plowman. Boötes contains the fourth-brightest star in the night sky, the orange giant Arcturus. It also contains Izar, a colourful multiple star popular with amateur astronomers. The name Boötes was first used by Homer in his Odyssey as a celestial reference point for navigation.  Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in Greek mythology is not clear.

"Lacerta": "Lacerta’s name is Latin for lizard. A small, faint constellation, it was defined in 1687 by the astronomer Johannes Hevelius. Its brightest stars form a W shape similar to that of Cassiopeia, and it is thus sometimes referred to as Little Cassiopeia. The stars of Lacerta, along with some in the eastern portion of Cygnus, were coincidentally combined by early Chinese astronomers into their Flying serpent. Similarly, the Chumash people of California call this part of the sky Lizard and include it in multiple stories.",
"Vulpecula": "Vulpecula is a faint constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for little fox, although it is commonly known simply as the fox.

Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. In ancient Egyptian astronomy, Aries was associated with the god Amon-Ra, who was depicted as a man with a ram's head and represented fertility and creativity. ",
"Cetus": "Cetus may have originally been associated with a whale, which would have had mythic status amongst Mesopotamian cultures. It is often now called the Whale, though it is most strongly associated with Cetus the sea-monster, who was slain by Perseus as he saved the princess Andromeda from Poseidon's wrath. Cetus is located in a region of the sky called The Sea because many water-associated constellations are placed there.",
